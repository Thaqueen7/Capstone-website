        <p>I would like to gather our elders and our youth in the same area working together to bring our community closer. Having our youth and elders work together but could not only improve their education it would encourage communication. Here are some of the ideas I have.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have the youth working with the elders</li>
            <li>Learning trades like cooking while they cook for the elders</li>
            <li>Start an elders mentoring program</li>
            <li>Recreation and story time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Inspirations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Kvai camp it teaches our youth how our ancestors lived back in the day</li>
            <p>I spent 6 years of my summer out there learning to live the traditional ways and loving my culture</p>
            <li>FNTC hearing about other ideas and people who want to change their community</li>
            <p>They are the absolute best school to make my dreams come true and give back to my community</p>
            <li>My mother has a passion for this to lead our youth for our elders</li>
            <p>She is my hero always worrying about our elders like she was taught to do and she has passed that onto me</p>
            <li>My sons</li>
            <p>My oldest is next in line to be my familys Chief and youngest will be our dancer so they inspire me to give back</p>
        </ol>
